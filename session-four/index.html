        <p>Designer's have long been asking for a seat at the executive table. These days, any credible board room is well stocked with c-suite level creatives (CMO, CCO, CDO); but now we want the throne!</p>
        
        <p>The Designer/CEO is the business worlds latest mutation. Will it prove unviable, only to whither and die? Is this a new species built to thrive in a creative economy? Or is has the designer's DNA always been an essential piece of executive success?</p>
        
        <p>Come watch as our panel of pros, practitioners, and pundits have it out. Will the design industry be a fertile training ground for next gen creative execs or should designers stick to what they do best and leave the business to the MBAs?</p>

            <p>You know her as SwissMiss, the mind behind the CreativeMornings event series, creator of TeuxDeux (the beautifully handy to-do app), and founder of Tattly (a "designy temporary tattoo shop"). But don't be deceived by the friendly demeanor â€” she has come from Brooklyn ready to battle. This Swiss is anything but neutral.</p>

            <p>Since co-founding Barbarian Group and growing it to a successful interactive agency, Rick has gone on to make his mark on the design and tech scene in New York and Beyond. He's done time as a consultant at Tumblr, partner at Quotidian Ventures, CEO of a Williamsburg Coworking space, and, it is rumored, on Rikers Island where he may or may not have led a Detainees Debate Club. He debates dirty, prison yard style.</p>

            <p>As pilot of one of the industry's most impressive outfits, Gadi has fearlessly led New Deal Design into collaborations with an impressive roster of clients, and in the process garnered enough awards to fill an Ikea showroom. He is a big proponent of working with your hands; either for designing beautiful objects or making intimidating gestures at opposing debaters. Watch out for the pointer finger of incontrovertibility.</p>
